# phased_array_simulations
Simulation of an optical phased array with multiple emitters in a hexagonal grid. That is, a calculation of the interference pattern from a number of lasers placed next to one another in a particular spatial pattern.

The model was written in c for speed. Sample plots of the output were generated using mathematica, these are the images included. They are plots of intensity over a plane perpendicular to the axis of emission some distance from the emittors.
